A friend was walking his dogs when they suddenly became excited outside an apartment complex and sniffed out a shoe box. Inside the shoe box was little Charlie! He was about 6 weeks old then, emaciated and dehydrated, just a scrap of skin and bones. He had a bad tummy virus but survived it after two weeks of antibiotics. Now he needs a permanent home! Charlie is very active, playful, and affectionate. He likes playing with other cats and sitting on people's laps. He uses his litterbox without fail. Charlie is best suited for indoor living, free-roaming inside a house or apartment. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Charlie are suitable for each other. Then you can meet and see if you get along :) - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. I am primarily an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate occasional updates and photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering at 6 months of age are COMPULSORY for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Look how Charlie started out! Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Imagine how bored, restless, and angry you'd be if you were locked up all the time. Prison is punishment! Interested parties can text or email me. An introduction of yourself, your experience with cats, and your approach to their care is greatly appreciated. Serious inquiries from responsible cat lovers only please.

He was trained to play rough by a muscular Judo Master. He acts like dog. Whenever he's tired or nervous, he'll start to breath fast, and stuck his tongue out, like a dog. Juliane (his owner) took Boy home for the first time, Boy barks. Later then he learns to meow. Other than Boy, there's Kate. She has nerve problem. Her brain deteriorates day by day and now Juliane focus on Kate who needs full attention. Every time Kate gets panic attack, that's when the brain will slowly damage.

We decided to bring him to our office and get him used to people, which wasn't a problem at all. And to litter train him,which was every easy to do as long as the litter box is cleaned at least twice a day. He really doesn't like a dirty litter box He enjoys exploring and doing his ""rounds"" around the office and play outdoors (done under strict supervision), once he is done with that he just likes to chill out and look good and handsome. He is very mellow and will follow you everywhere just like your shadow. He loves being around people and being given lots loving attention. He also loves to chat and is fairly vocal which, we believe, is due to Morrison having either Siamese or Burmese blood in him. If you want a quiet or silent cat Morrison isn't right for you. The adopter should have a home with an enclosed yard which is cat proofed as Morrison does enjoy a little romp around the yard and, if given the chance the neighbourhood. Safety is very important so that Morrison can give his love to his guardian. Morrison may be an ""older"" cat but trust me he has a wonderful personality and will make a great and loving companion to anyones home. Do watch the video to see Morrison enjoying the yard and basking in being petted and given the love and attention he deserves.

We found her over month ago by the road. She was starving, sick with flu and suffering from mange. After several weeks of treatment she is now healthy, although she has limited vision in her right eye. She is however full of enthusiasm and desperate to meet her forever family and start her new life! I have rescued many cats and kittens over the years and I have to say there is something special about this one. She is extremely loving, yet playful and entertaining at the same time. SHe loves to sit on your lap and look at you. I get the feeling she is genuinely very grateful for getting a second chance in life! Because she has touched our hearts so much, we are looking for an extra special home where she will get special care and attention. Because her sight is affected and she can't always judge distances, we would like her to go to a home where she will be kept as an indoor cat. This is very important. Other than this requirement, she would be happy with adults and children alike, and is happy to approach other cats too. As she will be an indoor cat it would be nice for her to go to a home with another cat so that she has some company whilst her human friends are out and about! It's always good to have two kittens together as they really do enjoy the company of their own species. Kayama has had her first vaccination and has been flea treated and dewormed. She is also litter trained but as with all kittens you will need to be patient as accidents can happen :) In adopting her you agree to make sure she is spayed at 6 months of age to prevent unwanted kittens, and also to keep us updated of her progress. Remember, cats can live around 20 years so in taking on Kayama you must be prepared to look after her for the rest of her life (including being able to pay vet bills as and when necessary). This is a serious commitment and only serious potential owners will be considered. Minimum adoption fee is RM. Any more than this would be greatly appreciated as we have spent over RM getting her well and healthy so any contribution enables us to continue on doing rescue and fostering work. If you would like to visit Kayama, she is living with us in Petaling Jaya so please do get in touch and we'll arrange to meet!",79db05f63,3,2

Be warned that she is a licker :) 2) She protectively guards the house, barking when people are near. So she makes a great guard dog/doorbell. 3) She does NOT bark all the time and annoy the neighbours 4) She is intelligent, e.g. she knew how to use my dog potty mat without any training, and will obey if you tell her to sit instead of jumping on you when you're eating. 5) She's not hyperactive but active enough that you can jog with her if you want a jogging companion. 6) Fully vaccinated, dewormed and spayed with no known health problems. However she was previously abandoned and possibly abused by her previous owner, resulting in some occasional aggression due to insecurity and fear. While she is friendly with most people and male dogs, she is occasionally (not always) aggressive when around other FEMALE DOGS, and in SMALL CONFINED SPACES or TIED UP for too long BY HERSELF. Meaning under these conditions, she might growl, snarl and in the case of female dogs, potentially fight with the other dog, but not all the time as she is usually playful with other females once she is used to them. She does NOT have this problem with male dogs and she also does NOT bite people, including children, unless you intentionally agitate her (in which case, you shouldn't be adopting a dog). So if you're an experienced dog owner with an open heart and willing to give an occasionally temperamental dog a loving home, please read on. Interested adopters should: - Be experienced in keeping dogs, as well as able to keep calm and handle somewhat aggressive dogs. Angel can easily be approached by a person she trusts and touched to calm her down as I do this often. - Preferably already have a mature and friendly MALE dog to keep her company, especially if you are frequently away. No female dog owners, for the reasons stated above. I have a male dog whom Angel gets along with perfectly fine. - Preferably have garden/porch for her to run in when you are out. Although she is used to living in a house, she will get agitated if you leave her in the house alone. She is fine if left by herself in a garden whole day or if someone or another dog is with her in the house. I'm giving Angel up not because I cannot stand her behaviour, but because I wish to do more dog rescue work which involves me temporarily keeping unfamiliar dogs, including nursing mothers, at my house, and I do not want her attacking the female dogs. Also because I may plan to move overseas in a few years and will take all my dogs, but Angel will be extremely stressed if in a plane and quarantine for a long period. Thanks for reading, and if interested to give Angel a wonderful forever home, please call Carol at. Located in Subang Jaya.",a906ff5f5,6,4

She is so friendly and loving and so unbelievably cute. Sadly we already have a male rescue kitten who's much older and bigger and they are not gelling well at all, so she's being kept in a smaller room and she deserves to be in a safe home where she can run around free. When I took her to the vet on Monday 29th May they said to wait a week to have her first vaccination, so I'm taking her back for this on Monday 5th June. She'll then need to go back for her second vaccination a month after that so if you take her before then you'll need to do this. Then of course she'll need her spaying when she's at least 6 months old, she's only 7 weeks old right now. A beautiful, friendly and sociable kitten, completely healthy, she'd make a wonderful asset to any loving home.

They are two little beauties with the smoothest, glossiest fur i have ever touched. These brothers are extremely close and I want them to be ADOPTED TOGETHER. Mr fluffers is the leader of the two as he is more daring, outgoing, and openly affectionate. Cocochino harbors some fear of strangers and it took him a long time to warm up to me. He follows what his brother does all the time. So, when he sees that fluffers and i are having fun together, he loosens up and joins in. He loses his fear when he is together with fluffers, separate them and his fears return. If you are looking for INDOOR cats and don't mind their high energy play, you can call me at . Adopter must be a very patient person as Cocochino will not be immediately friendly, must be willing to put in effort to build a relationship with these boys, a true cat lover. The succesful adopter will have to reimburse me for Mr Fluffers and Cocochino's neutering and vaccinations at which point i will hand over their medical booklets. This means the adopter must pay me back for what i have spent on their neutering and vaccinations. I don't make a profit. They have received their first and second vaccinations.

He immediately paid a desperate call to pet rescuer, animal rights activist, and Pawse for a Cause founder, Seema Subash, for urgent assistance.

She loves to jump around (she's not crippled, she can walk and run like normal cats) and loves attention. A long stroke on her body will send her meowing at you. She's neutered [updated 7th May ].

Got a friend to check him out while I rush to my appointment and he was not found. After 9 hours, passed by again and saw him at the exact same spot waiting. Once I stopped my car, he came towards me wagging his tail. I'm VERY sure this is a dumping case, because there is no strays around or pregnant female dogs at the nearest strays area. This is what humans are capable of. He is probably just 4 months old, don't even know what is going on or how to fend for himself. He has got dandruff all over his top fur. And he looks so hungry. We named him Leshem, meaning precious. Because life is precious no matter in which form. He has been treated at the vet, showered, dewormed and vaccinated. He is back home with us now while waiting for a forever home he can count on as family. This is a result of irresponsible ownership, attitudes of just buying a pet, not neutering and then running away from responsibility. These are lives, not a bag you can just dump aside as you wish. Be responsible, be a human with a heart. Adopt, don't buy or shop. Neuter your pets.",7adf54516,7,3

Father was a Ragdoll and mother is an American Curl (given up by previous owners while pregnant). ♥ Christian is both a rambunctious player and a shy little love-dove! He is careful of new situations as much as he tests them, and once he warms up, he can skip over at his humans better than the fastest bunny. He's our favourite boy and it took a lot of heart to place him for adoption - heavy purrer (he'll sound like an engine!) and especially loves being stroked and kissed while carried. He can be a lap-cat when relaxing (not while he's busy playing of course, he'll jump off). Also enjoys being shown around the house. ♥ He's already had his first vaccination and deworming. Not fussy about kibble or wet food and is very clever with the litter box! ***IMPORTANT: Note For Potential Adopters*** - Christian must be kept INDOORS at all times. Apartments must be cat-safe. - He's been raised since birth on a grain-free healthy diet and this must be maintained (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc). Feel free to inquire if unsure, this is for any cat's long term well being. - Neutering is COMPULSORY and we will reject anyone who doesn't fit this requirement. There are far too many homeless kittens on the streets. If you feel that you may be just the right person for this boy, please drop me a message with details about yourself and your experience with cats (via WhatsApp or email). Thank you!",183eb3fe5,14,3

However she wasn't very active cause she was still very tired and also had a slight limp. She looks like she is a american eskimo although I doubt she is a pure breed. When we found her she wasn't smelly even. when she was fully soaked. Which lead us to conclude that she hasn't been homeless for more than 5 days.

Our situation dosnt allow us to permanently adopt her since we are students with a very limited income. As well as we are already caring for a beautiful dog who we rescued 3 years ago.

Much love, Shakira and Oli ------------------------------------------------------- Hey guys, I have 3 adorable mixed breed female puppies, Shadoh the little black one, Oli and Peanut are white with black patches. They were found motherless and hungry on the streets by a friend. I've had them since 14th Feb (a week now) and will care for them till I find them good homes. They have been de-wormed and vaccinated and I have the vaccination cards as proof. They are not spayed as I don't think it is necessary. I have a 5 year old Golden Retriever that isn't spayed and is perfect, I may spay her in the near future to prevent ovarian cancer. I am leaving the choice up to the adopt-ers. Peanut is a sweetheart, timid, quiet and loves food; Oli is full of energy, curious, loving and very friendly, she was the first to approach my big Retriever; Shadoh is slightly smaller in size, fun and adventurous and also very loving and friendly. Shadoh and Oli always play together and are inseparable so I'm hoping these two could be adopted by one home. But 3 separate homes are more than welcome too. They are all so loving and cheeky. I am HOPING to have them house trained by the time one of you chooses to adopt them. I'm looking for caring dog lovers with families to care for these lil' cuties. I would love to keep them for myself but am leaving the country by the end of March. So PLEASE contact me(calls preferred) if you are interested. We can set up a meeting for you to meet them in person before deciding. Much love, Shakira, Oli, Shadoh and Peanut Bangsar, KL.",40501d365,1,3

My mum gave birth at the underground car park of an apartment, that’s how me and my siblings were brought to the world, there are 12 of us. Not long after that, my mum was diagnosed with cervical cancer, fortunately she survived after four chemotherapy treatments. And here is my little story. Not long after I was born, I met with an accident and suffered serious concussion, I was wounded with 3 holes in my little head.. Because of that, while all my siblings started to walk I had difficulty to even stand up. In addition to that, I have blurred vision, my cranial nerves were hurt by the accident I suppose.. I have no idea when I’ll recover, maybe it will stay like that forever. Luckily, after 2 months of medication, I’m able to stand and walk now, although I stumbled from time to time. My temporary caretaker has difficulty to keep for me long, I hope that I could meet with a kind master through Facebook. I know people may not like me because of my poor condition, but I’ll pray and hope for a miracle. If you wished to make the miracle happen, please contact my temporary caretaker(Annie). Thank you. 大家好，我的名字叫小龙。我是一只4个多月大的宅男。 妈妈在一个公寓地下停车场里生下了我们12个兄弟姐妹。 妈妈生下了我们之后，得了子宫颈癌。还好，经过4次的化疗之后， 总算挨过了这一关。 好了，说一说我的小故事吧！ 我出世没多久，在一次意外中，我的小脑袋遭到了严重的撞击，破了3个洞。 从此，当其他的兄弟姐妹已经会走路时，我竟然连爬起来都有问题。 还有，我看东西时也是模模糊糊的。我想我的脑部神经可能被弄坏掉了。 我不知道我几时会好起来，或许永远都会是这样。 幸好，吃了两个月的药以后，我总算可以站起来走路。然而，有时还是会跌跌撞撞的。 由于暂养我的主人不能长期收留我，所以我想透过面子书， 寻找一位愿意照顾我一辈子的好心人。 只是，以我这样的生世，或许很难吧。。。。。 有意领养我的好心人，请联络我的暂养主人(Annie)。 我会在这里努力的生活到最后一刻，乖乖的等待我的新主人。请别让我等太久哦。。。 谢谢大家。",0c5d5968b,8,3

I thought I would die no one cared. I was down to skin and bones, you could even see my hips and spine! She cried seeing me and alerted the fb community. My rescuers came the very next day all the way from KL to rescue me. Finally my prayers are answered! I'm better now but I understand they are active rescuers and need to rescue more pitiful neglected dogs. For me, I'm hoping to find a new master, one who wouldn't abandon me or left me chained for many weeks despite my cries and barks. One who wouldn't leave me hungry for long weeks. I'm not able to talk but from the wag of my tail or big sunny smile you will know my deep love and gratitude. I'm good natured not rough, I don't bark unnecessarily and I'm gentle with children.

He is a perfect kitten - healthy, playful, friendly and eats with a big appetite. He enjoys hanging out with humans and seems to like smelly feet. He is, therefore often very close to your legs, so the adopter must be always careful to check where he is before stepping! Boots purrs loudly, but has a surprisingly soft and gentle meow even when he is yowling for his nom noms. Some important info: * Checked by vet and de-flea and de-worm treatment was done on 18 June. * Vaccination has to be given when he gets bigger - when he reaches about 2-3 months old. * The adopter has to make sure that he gets quality fresh food so that his tuxedo coat looks like its made of satin and silk all the time. * The adopter has to make sure that he is neutered when he reaches 6 months old to ensure he gets a good chance at a long healthy life.

She has her flea treatment done & was de-wormed today, 27th May . She is healthy but not so playful. She enjoys looking other kittens play and she will just sit quietly watching at a side.

They have to be adopted together as a pair because they are familiar with each other. The reason being is because I am moving away soon and my new place is shared with other people and I think does not allow pets. Another reason is financial reason. I might not be able to afford their medical expenses in the future so if anything, I will have difficulty to pay. The cats are Hinata and Mimi. Both are already neutered and toilet trained so can be kept inside. Or outside if you'd like because they like to wander around. Just make sure the neighbourhood is safe enough. Hinata - Female, Tortoiseshell, about 2 years old. Shy and timid around strangers but once she is familiar with you, she'll be very relaxed and lazy. Mimi - Female, Calico, about 4 years old. Jumpy and alert. Clingy and get attached with you very well when she knows you. There are some things I will provide for you. - Closed litter box with flapped door - Food bowls - Medical books for each of them - Cage I have to give them away within a week or so.

She has a rough medium length coat (black and white). ♥ Kayla is under foster care as her family had to travel overseas due to unforeseen circumstances. Kayla is now seeking a permanent new family. _________________________________________________ Character: ♥ Kayla is an intelligent and high energy dog. She loves taking walks (especially running around fields, beaches, hiking, etc). If you're an active person, she will happily tag along on a leash as you do your daily runs/cycling/etc. :) ♥ DESPITE her energy; Kayla is a VERY calm dog when indoors! She will only get onto beds/sofas if invited and otherwise makes herself comfy where she can. ♥ Kayla understands a few commands like ""sit"", ""stay"" and ""shake"". She was also trained to wait for her food and walk off leash by her previous owners (however I have not followed up on this during the period of foster care). ♥ She has an amazing temperament too! Gets along well with dogs (cats also if she sees them indoors/as part of the family. Kayla is especially patient and loving around children, She's the type of dog that would lie in bed with the kids and keep them feeling safe/protected. ♥ Kayla requires NO grooming whatsoever as her fur stays the length it already is. She also hardly ""smells"" and only needs a bath once a month at most if indoors (unless she's really had a muddy run somewhere or rolled where she shouldn't). ♥ Kayla loves water too! She will half-sit in a pool, even chase after water sprinkling out of a hose. :) ♥ Potty habits; When indoors, Kayla will bark 3 - 4 times in a row to let her people know she needs to be let out to do her business. She appreciates routine daily walks (at least once in the morning, another in the evening before bedtime). ♥ Kayla is fully vaccinated (rabies shots included). She is also spayed, parasite free and micro-chipped. She is not fussy about food either. _________________________________________________ *** PLEASE READ (Note for potential adopters) *** ♥ Kayla takes time to adjust to new people (at least 2 weeks to trust). She will bond closely to anyone who pays the most attention to her. She will accept ""firm"" tones when being trained but NO rough tones/scolding of any kind. ♥ Kayla likes being indoors % EXCEPT when she needs to be taken out for some form of activity. Adopters practicing this are preferred. ♥ Kayla needs round the clock attention (she will get anxious if left crated any longer than 4 hours a day). Adopters with lots of time on their hands are her best preference. ♥ An adoption fee will apply to cover Kayla's basic care (please inquire).

Naturally, He was very traumatised. Could we blamed him for behaving aggressively to all near his cage. He was just trying to frighten intruders away to save his own skin. How else ? He is an animal & confined in a cage amidst a crowd of milling people.He was to be euthanized but SAS thought otherwise. It took us 4 months for him to trust us.We named him Mohawk. His colouring is like an Red Indian with a band of white against rich brown diagonally across his neck.His ears are upright.His chest is white & he has white socks too with a bushy tail. Furthermore, he moves as if he is on a hunt. Mohawk is not aggressive at all. Infact, he plays like a child. All our Ketum dogs play like kids. They don't play in any aggressive manners. For a time , he likes to come near & lift the kennel hand's skirt.He loves his name & pricks up his ears whenever called. 2 teenagers lads told their dad he looks like a film star.

I'm trying to find loving homes for the 4 gorgeous puppies we found and rescued late one night in April. We found the puppies abandoned on a hillside behind where we are staying and I'm sorry to say it looked as if they had been thrown there and left. At first we didn't think they would have the strength to survive after the trauma as their eyes were still all closed and they were no bigger than my hand. How wrong I was! They are clearly born resilient and made a rapid recovery. There have been many sleepless nights of bottle feeding the 4 puppies, trust me we've had our hands full! But now I'm really happy to say that despite their rough start they are starting to blossom into the most lovely little puppies with a fantastic temperament. Sadly, I am only in Malaysia traveling visiting family and diving and I am due to return home to the UK very soon. I have looked into relocating the puppies there but at their age it is very difficult to do so and I fear I will not have enough time or funds to relocate them all. With this in mind I am looking to find them loving families that they can grow and be a part of. They have had weekly check-ups at the vets, of which I have put together individual medical history file for each puppy. These happy and healthy puppies have been de-wormed and are in the process of their vaccinations (receiving their first dose .14)...please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or would like to arrange to come and see the puppies. xox 12 PAWS LEFT….!",7e43a342a,5,4

She seemed like the oldest of the bunch as she matured faster than her sisters. She likes to play with her twin and loves to chill and relax. Like her twin, she has already started eating wet food and a bit of dried food. Wouldn't hurt to give some kitten milk, so maybe just get one pack and finish it up. I'm currently training her and her siblings to use the litter box and it seems that they know where to do their business now so that's good. If interested in one, or more of them, please call/sms me at or email me. Unfortunately I don't have whatsapp, but if you need any additional pictures to be sent, please let me know your emails and I'll send them over.",4555f9273,2,1

Timtams are now part of a loving family of parents +3kids+a maid and loving the wonderful corner house with grass in the compound! ----- TimTams (one is Tim, one is Tam)- to make it easier to call them! Potential adopters should be able to commit to: 1) walking the dogs 2x a day (or keep them in secured bungalow/semi-d/corner house with vast area to roam, as they love running and playing) 2) spend time playing with them (they're still quite young, and will whine for attention unless given regular affection-time with keeper) 3) give fresh water daily & proper food (they eat kibbles) 4) keep shoes in proper shoe cabinet cos one of them is still displaying puppy behaviour of chewing shoes or moving them around (unless he gets adequate exercise and attention) They appear to be brothers, and was roaming Ara Damansara area when found. Plus points about these dogs: 1) trainable: know how to sit/shakehand/come 2) loves children and will play with kids - excellent FAMILY PETs! 3) chase cats (but don't attack them) 4) will bark at strangers - good alert dogs! 5) friendly to keeper and friends 6) great with older folks because of gentle nature - makes excellent FAMIlY PETs! 7) get along with other dogs, even male dogs (possibly because not fully sexually mature and also very gentle + playful in nature), so can join family with existing dogs. NOTE: Will only entertain genuine adopters who'd take either one or both dogs as family pets. They get along well with other dogs. Tim once ran up to an Alsation in my neighbourhood and I thought he'd be minced meat, but they got along fine!

I did not have the heart to leave it there as I saw no signs of its mother nearby. So I took it home and fed it with some food and gave it a quick wash. I went to the vet next day and bought a bottle and milk for cats and it has been drinking from the bottle. Not only is he playful and adorable, he is also quite clever as he has been pee-ing at the same place (in a shoe box laid with newspapers). He is always cleaned afterwards. A very friendly and active little guy, purrs almost all the time now especially after being fed (even knows where he can get his milk from!). Unfortunately, my wife and I are not able to look after him as we are both working until late night. We would like to find a home for this little guy, with or without a foster mother cat, as he can already be fed using a bottle, and can already eat soft food. As much as we are already attached to this little fella, we know that being in a house with caring people to look after him, he'd be much better off without a couple of busy people like us. And we would be happy to see him grow with love and become a handsome cat. ----- Updating again after we gave Sim away to his new family. My husband and I cried our eyes out from missing him last night. I still feel all choked up when I look at his pictures and videos. The night my husband brought him in, we didn't have anything suitable to feed a kitten with but an ikan goreng. As desperate as he was, we had to give him something to eat, so ikan goreng it was. And a few drops of Dutch Lady's full cream milk. The next day, we had only planned to drop him at a local vet, in hoping that a good samaritan would take him in, but the clerk said they don't take animals in, so we ended up buying the little fella a bottle and 2 boxes of milk for cats. Since then we had been feeding him the milk. We left Sim at home and when we came back later that night, we saw him sitting quietly at one spot. And we also saw spots of white vomit and yellow-ish liquidy stool. After immediately cleaning him up, Sim looked sleepy. I thought he might be tired from vomiting like humans would. So I wrapped him up and cuddled him. After a while, I thought something was strange about him. Usually he would wake up if there was even a slight movement, this time he didn't even stir. I also noticed that he squirted liquid from his rectum while he was sleeping. It was night, no vets would still be open. So I read up a website, at which describes a condition of a kitten from its stool and urine's color and texture. I suspected that he might be suffering from food poisoning (the ikan goreng and the Dutch Lady milk). I was devastated thinking that Sim might not last that night as his body was so weak, his head just lolled if unsupported, his paws were almost cold, all the signs I though that he was really dying. I couldn't bear the thought of seeing him die all by myself as my husband was at work at that time. All I could do that night was rub him to keep him warm and pray that he'd be ok. I was already so smitten by this kitten, although we couldn't keep it, I really wanted it to live. Miraculously, my prayers were answered when Sim suddenly got up, eyes wide open and started roaming the room. I was like ""were you playing tricks on me?"". It was really miraculous! I couldn't explain it if it's actually normal but I was extremely grateful. I still am today. After the gruesome experience, we went the extra mile to look after him, like looking after a human baby. Brought him a proper food for kitten, took him to the vet when he didn't pee and poo one whole day. As it turns out, he was still too young to pee on his own, so whenever he wanted to pee, he would let out signs which I finally figured out that if when he is meowing but wanted neither food nor milk, I would put him in the shoebox, stimulate him and if he didn't resist, he would proceed to pee until he is done. At first I have mixed feelings about touching an animal at its genitals but after the first time and seeing how at ease he felt, it really made me feel like a momcat. In those six days we took care of him, we were quite surprised that a lot of people were asking for him from this advert. For that, thank you all for your interest, it really meant a lot to us. The morning before we gave him up, I decided to give him a little wash. As I know that all cats hate cold water, I bathed him in warm water and he LOVED it, didn't squirm, didn't kick around, didn't scratch me for putting him in such a spot! At one point, I thought he wanted to immerse himself in the water. Haha! And then I wrapped him up and he fell asleep again before I fed him one last time. Throughout the one hour journey to his new owner, Sim just slept away. We really think that he is so much like a human baby who would fall asleep in car rides because of the aircond and the feeling of the car moving. :) Sim Sim... After handing him over, the new owner has been keeping in touch with us to ask what should she do if Sim is giving certain signs. I felt a bit worried if Sim's signs were misread, and all those sort of stuff a mom would typically be worried of. Text messages from the new owner saying that he likes to climb on top of people and follow them around the house, all the things Sim did to us showed us that he is settled at his new home and his new family. I tell myself that he'll be alright. It's weird that I have kittens at my parents' place but none made me feel like Sim did. None made me feel so emotionally attached like Sim made me feel. Though he might not even know us, what more remember us, we pray that he'll grow happily and healthily. Thank you Sim for the wonderful experience you have given us.",b1c83d13b,4,1

Seeing the deplorable condition the puppy is living in (lying around the floor with spilled engine oil, water container contaminated with all sorts of automobile oil and God knows if he's been fed properly), the car owner decided to probe a bit further into how he's been treated all this while. According to some folks around that area, Bear Bear used to have 3 other siblings but Bear Bear is the only one left as the other three were run down by cars which came to the workshop to get their cars fixed. Bear Bear has been brought to the vet for a checkup and blood test. Blood test results show that he's fighting some form of infection and is currently on a course of antibiotics. He has also got cherry eyes (the large red mass bulging out of the inner corner of his eyes. those are actually his own tear glands which popped out) . Anyone who knows about cherry eyes will know that it's a condition which is not visually appealing, but fairly common (especially in certain breeds, Shar Pei is one of them) . However it's actually benign (non life threatening) and can be corrected via surgery. Bear Bear is currently under observation and boarding at the vet's clinic. If all goes well, he would be vaccinated in a couple of days. Since the cherry eye condition is non life threatening, priority is given towards treating his infection. Bear Bear is very friendly towards humans and quiet (not whiny, and exudes a calm personality) We are currently appealing for anyone who can help foster him till he recovers from infection and ready for adoption. Kindly drop us a note at if you could foster Bear Bear whilst we work on getting him rehomed. Please contact Mun Ee for more info =) www.facebook.com/PawsMission",4b4bb2b0a,5,4

But when we saw the state in which Lucky was in when he was found by our neighbour (wound marks on his neck and body), we had a change of heart. We knew Lucky needed us. We took him to the vet to be vaccinated. He was found to have heart worm hence the breathlessness which we noticed when we played with him. We got him treated. It was a stressful three months during the treatment period since he was not to be excitable for fear of getting a stroke. It was difficult because he was an energetic dog who gets happy and excited whenever we are around. Thankfully, he survived and has since been living a healthy life. Lucky is playful, loving and very loyal. He loves company and is very affectionate. He gets along well with kids.

I am very strict about not caging my fur kids and hope you don’t cage them (unless required by vet). Cats are curious animals and are constantly exploring their surroundings. Give them space to walk and run around. But also remember to kitty proof your house. Good Quality Food: My cats are fed some sort of premium brands. Good quality food is important to maintain their health and more beneficial for you in the long run (less vet visits!) Companions: Cats are very social animals and it is healthier to adopt two so they can have another cat to play or interact with. Especially if you are busy at work or otherwise most of the day :). But if you can only get one cat, then please consider adopting an adult cat. Adult cats are usually litter box trained, spayed and easier to take care. Their personality is developed and you know what you get. They are also more independent and mellow in their games and spend a lot of time napping ;). Medical/vets: My cats are not spayed/neutered if less than 6 months. You must agree to do so at 6 months. You must also agree to give booster shots (if required) and yearly veterinary examination. Other Conditions: I love to receive updates on their progress with pictures. Taking care of fur kids is easy. All they need is some food, lots of love & attention and they will be at your side all their life. But before adopting, please consider your financial situation. Good quality food, vet visits, etc will need to be budgeted.",9193c38af,2,4

She was really frail and quite dirty with a skin condition, and was looking for a kind person to cuddle up to and not so much for food. But of course Malaysians being Malaysians, most of them shoo-ed her away and some even kicked her. The coffee shop owner then informed me that her mother had recently been killed - someone had poisoned her. As I usually have a small amount of dog food with me in the car, I gave her some. She ate a little but just wanted to be petted. She then went to another table curled up at the feet of this old man. Thankfully this man did not kick her. I asked several people if they would take her, but of course none would. In the end, I asked the shop owner for a box and brought her home. I just could not bring myself to leave her there. I took her to the vet and it was confirmed that she had a severe case of sarcoptic mange. She was treated with Ivermectin for 5 weeks and she is now a healthy, active puppy. We're not entirely sure what breed she is, but she looks like she could have some Jack Russell in her and possibly some Dalmation as well as she has quite a lot of spots... She has just received her first vaccination and will be completing the remaining 2 shots soon. She has a very good temperament and is good with other dogs. She is curious about our cat and has shown no signs of aggression towards it. She is very playful and is a fast learner.

She can likely be taught to be a lap-kitten, enjoys strokes and being baby-talked. She is the best climber and learns things real quick!

Not fussy about kibble or wet food and is very clever with the litter box! ***IMPORTANT: Note For Potential Adopters*** - Coco must be kept INDOORS at all times. Apartments must be cat-safe. - She's been raised since birth on a grain-free healthy diet and this must be maintained (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc).

Must be treated as a member of the family and not as guard dogs. 3. Preferably kept indoors, but outdoors is fine as long as there is sufficient shelter from the heat and rain. 4. Must not cage or chain the dogs unecessarily for extended periods. 5. Must be fed good food and given water daily! (yes some people don't think this is important) 6. MUST be neutered at 6 months of age. A refundable deposit of RM per puppy will be collected for this. 7. MUST be given medical care by a vet if required. 8. There will be a home inspection before the puppies are released to you. 9. MUST allow us to visit the pups twice after adoption - we will not impose on you and your family unnecessarily, and send us picture/video updates from time to time. 10. MUST not dump the dogs when it is no longer convenient to care for them. Remember a dog is for life. If you are unable to commit to care for the dogs for their entire lifetime, please do NOT adopt. ******************** These two gorgeous pups were dumped behind my vet's clinic. They are super playful, loves cuddles and loves to eat too! The two of them are very attached to each other, and are best buddies, so that's why I named them Ron Weasley & Harry Potter because they're inseparable!

She wasn't sure when the kittens were placed there, but she knew the poor kittens had at least traveled one journey in there, probably traumatized beyond belief. Since the lady did not know how long the kittens were there, she could not know where they came from and where their mother is, and this is when my aunt called me for help. I named them Nobu (the white one) and Yoshi (the orange one) after Japanese warlords Nobunaga and Hideyoshi. Strong names for two strong boys. Nobu had an eye infection at the time of rescue, but had cleared up now with eye ointment. Both kittens had also been dewormed at the same time. They are currently about 1.5 months old to be accurate. I had successfully weaned them off milk, and they can eat kibbles on their own now. (RC baby kitten) Though they do still enjoy milk on the occasion. They are litter trained, though can still get messy at times kicking litter all over. Yoshi the orange tabby is the older brother, the bigger of the two. He has the CUTEST round eyes and can be quite manja. He is more mild mannered compared to Nobu, but is a fast learner. He purrs loudly. Nobu is the younger one but he is also the adventurous one. He is extremely curious and likes to explore wherever he can get to via whatever method he can. (jump, climb etc) However, he can be a bit messy, spilling kibbles all over, getting milk beards, stepping into the water bowl etc. He has a super cute 'mew' though! Both kittens are extremely playful, Yoshi especially LOVES to play with feathers. They can also be potential lap cats. I used to bottle feed milk to them on my lap sitting on a small stool, even though I don't now since they broke their milk bottle, sometimes they still like to climb onto my lap and I'll pet them. ******SERIOUS ADOPTERS ONLY****** - It would be most preferable if they can be adopted together, I don't want to split the two brothers since they are quite attached to each other. - They must be spayed at the age of 6-8 months. - The brothers must be kept INDOORS since they do not grow up on the streets and are not street smart.

As a result, I decided to spay her and rehome her since she's still young. - She has no tail deformity unlike most other domestic cats. - She was dewormed by a vet on 20 June . - She has been applied with Revolution on 5 August to protect her against ticks, fleas, ear mites, heartworms & intestinal worms for a month. - Her weight is 4.15 kg as at 7 August , a gain of 0.65kg since 10 July . - I'm feeding her with premium dry cat kibbles. - She can drink water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled twice a day to condition the cat to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage her health and shorten her life. - She's toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using pine litter which is good for her (& human's) health and the environment. - Her poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as her overall health. - She has been spayed on 28 June at a cost of RM. - She has been vaccinated on 10 July at a cost of RM50. - Booster vaccination and deworming on 7 August at a cost of RM68. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. 2) The cat must be kept indoors at all times. 3) Vaccinate her yearly to protect against diseases. 4) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 5) The RM50 adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only partially cover the RM spaying, vaccination & deworming costs which I'm subsidising. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. If you're interested to adopt California, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience.

We brought him home to nurse him back to health and found that he was the sweetest, most loving, kind and playful kitten ever (and i've had quite a few kittens in my life). Now at 6 weeks he is fully recovered and in NEED of a home as we will shortly be leaving the country. I can't stress enough how sad i am to part with this amazing cat and what a perfect pet he will be. If it was up to me I would most certainly keep him. We were looking at shelters to drop him to but i would feel much better placing him directly with a new owner. The most important thing to us is to find him an equally loving family to take him in. He is a tiny little guy. Pale golden cream tabby with white paws and belly. Right now his eyes are blue but they will probably develop as he matures. He is fully potty trained and is on a diet of baby cat food mixed with warm water (to soften it). Personality wise, he is very adaptable. We pulled him off the streets scared and untrained and within a day he figured out the cat box. Within two days he was coming over to sit on our laps and cuddle! As with most kittens his age he is playful but tends to entertain himself. He LOVES pets and will spend hours with you purring away with any attention you give him. Please contact me if you are at all interested. Time is of the essence! we will be leaving in less than two weeks!

To be willing to provide regular updates on their progress during the first 3 months or until they are spayed/neutered. Procedures to be taken care of by me prior to their adoption: *De-flea, deworm, vaccinate (1st dose) I cannot stress enough the importance of neutering and spaying of pets to prevent unwanted litters and ultimately, controlling the stray population. As such, only potential adopters who believe in spaying/neutering their pets OR those who are willing to learn about spaying/neutering will be considered. They will be ready for adoption after they settle down, but I will screen potential adopters now. kittens can be adopted individually or together, I can deliver them to their new home within KL / Klang Valley Area.

My parents always wanted me to put them up for adoption as I already own 3 dogs and I will be leaving to Overseas to further my studies. However, I was worrying too much about helping them to search for the perfect owner and to be honest I was really reluctant to give them away until I found this website. Below are the basic info about them. Name: Simba She was name after the lion called 'Simba' from the ""Lion King"" due to her fur colour. She has golden brown fur from head to toe, a pair of sparkling golden brown eyes and a cute pinky brown nose. She is very active and friendly, but a little shy when it comes to meeting strangers. However, I believed after a few days, she will be just fine and friendly with the ""stranger"". She loves running around and naps when she is tired of running. Simba is more of a big sister to Sandy as Sandy always follow Simba around whenever she goes. Besides that, she is also very loving and I believed that she is not any less good than popular dog breeds like Golden Retriever. Name: Sandy She is sister of Simba and was named after the squirrel called Sandy in Spongebob as her personality is the completely opposite with the Squirrel in Spongebob so I thought it would be cute to name her Sandy. She has short shiny coated black fur from head to toe, an innocent pair of black eyes and a black nose. Her personality is very similar to Simba as she is very shy, active, loves running around, loving and innocent. Both of them are the perfect family dogs and they can guard the house pretty well. #FunFacts about them that make them adorable: 1. They are afraid of fireworks. 2. They are always wag their tails when you are home! 3. They love being pet and never get sick of being complimented. 4. Just simply because they are super ADORABLE AND LOVABLE!",c634af483,5,4

Can't take in another dog as I already have a Shih Tzu of my own. Will put him up for adoption if cannot find his owner in 7 days. If anyone is interested to adopt him please send me an e-mail. This dog is well taken care of by his previous owner, nails are trimmed, no ticks nor fleas and he doesn't bark much. He is potty-trained too. He pees and poos outside the house. UPDATE (17 June, ): Re-captured Bravo in the neighbourhood. He looked tired and weary. This doggie has a habit of escaping by jumping through the high gate and window after getting warm shower, food, and shelter (for a night or two) from the rescuer. He has made ""Running Away"" his lifetime profession and it really broke our hearts. Thus, we have no choice but to put him up for adoption. We do not believe in caging or putting a leash on the dogs. In Bravo's case, it is different. If we are not careful, he'll escape once again (he's a good jumper). Today we brought him to the nearby vet to check if he has a microchip embedded in his body. But the scanner couldn't locate any. Therefore any attempt to find the original owner is futile. (In addition, I believe its master also gave up long time ago on a runaway delinquent like Bravo.) So if you are STILL interested to adopt Bravo, please contact me. Breeders’ requests will not be entertained. We’ll scan through all the prospective candidates to find Bravo a good home. UPDATE (18 June, ): Due to overwhelming responses and my phone number becoming a hotline, I have decided to post up my questions (here) for those who are interested to adopt Bravo. Please e-mail your reply to me. Do NOT post your answers in the comments section. 1) Name: 2) Phone: 3) E-mail: 4) Age: 5) Profession: 6) Do you live in your own property? (Yes/No) 7) Do you stay in a house/flat/apartment/condo? 8) Will there be someone at home when you are away for work or school? 9) Do you have a pet of your own? (Pet's details - Name, age, dog/cat, spayed, etc.) 10) Do you cage your pets? Why? 11) If your pet doesn't want to eat its food, what will you do? 12) How are you going to manage or take care of a dog which makes ""Running Away"" its lifetime profession?",1528d2a61,12,2

They weren't abandoned by their parents. It's just that being canine, unlicensed ones, their parents were captured by MBSA two years ago. Since then, residents of have been taking care of them by feeding and sheltering them whenever possible. As they are females, they have all been neutered (at 9 months old) to ensure unsolicited attention from other male canines. Bobby (a female but named such), in human being's term, is like an autistic child. She was traumatised by her parents' abduction at an early age and is extremely afraid of human. She is very attached to Nike (the male Alsation, living in the first house, two doors away). It's extremely difficult to capture her, even MBSA has failed many times. Clever, as she was taken away from her mum at birth(someone adopted her and didn't want her after a few months) and was whining and pining for her for the initial few weeks..... she is pretty hyper, short fused and likes to chase cars.... and strangers.... so I am terribly if anyone here has been chased or barked by her. However, her bark is worse than her bite, just give her a shout and fierce look,she will run off....... She is a very good watch dog though..... and very obediently comes back to the house after she has done her share of running for the night. She doesn't eat much but more frequent than usual (three small portion), not choosy about her food and she's fine with water. She isn't the lovey dovey type though. As for Hong Hong, she is definitely the prima donna type. Loves to be cuddled, will know how to win back your heart after being naughty. She will look at you with her almond shaped eyes and lift her paws and rest them on you...... She's awfully afraid of thunder and will hide behind you or try to get into the house whenever it rains cats and dogs. She hates water and chooses food) For months now, i have kept Clever and Hong Hong in my house. Sometimes they do escaped but they will still head home for food. Bobby, she's outside, she has been taking care of herself. I just feed her dinner every evening. Actually, the three of them are part of a litter of 8. We have managed to get the rest adopted..... It is with a heavy heart that i have to put Clever and Hong Hong up for adoption. One of the main reasons is, my son and I are acute bronchitis sufferers and having dogs in our compound aren't helping with our condition. Secondly, i am having some muslim students coming to my house for classes next year and it is not convenient for the dogs to be around....... Hong Hong can be a really good companion dog and Clever, a good watch dog..... If you know of anyone who is looking for such dogs, please let me know.... my contact no is. Only serious inquiries will be entertained. Thank you very much for your kind attention. BTW, April, one of their siblings, is staying at one of the neighbour's house along too..... so actually is a doggy's lane..... most of us love dogs, and because of them, we are a closely knitted neighbourhood..... we know each other well and watch out for one another..... Hope adopting Hong Hong or Clever will bring such atmosphere to your neighbourhood too.... Cheers..... I am up by one now coz a neighbour who initially taken one of the female pups have decided not to keep the pups......",379d5e10d,1,4

BonBon was the only survivor from 5 siblings and was abandoned by her mother so I took her in. She used to be alone. I let her stay in my house with my other cats so she can have friend. She doesn’t mind being around with the adults and just be herself. She is playful, independent and sweet. Her energy level is high and she is very active. She doesn't really like to be cuddled. She likes to play rough. She doesn't meow a lot. She can get along with other cat; just give her time to adjust. She is suitable with a home with 1 or two adult cats. Younger kitten may be bullied by her because she is the baby in my house. Important : This is not an average pet, a cat who will sit on your lap, who love being petted and cuddled. I have her almost 2 months, and catching her to trim her claws or just to hold her still is an ordeal.But she really likes to play, all my cats will lose interest but she's the only one who still eye-balling the toys e.g feather teaser.She never comes to me and rubs herself just like my cats greet me. The only time she's interested to me is when it's feeding time or when no one wants to entertain or play with her. Sometimes she bites to get what she wants. I can give you some advice on how to handle her. If you want her to keep another cat company, she is perfect! And pretty low-maintenance,you can just give her food and water and that's it. Please give BonBon a loving home. With love, patience and affection from you, I'm sure she will be the most loving bouncy furkid you ever had. Please take note: Rm is imposed as a safe deposit which will be returned to the owner once the owners spay BonBon within 3 months.

My wife is giving birth to our first child in January and the reason we want to find a new home is that we do not want a dog around a small baby. Based on looks … for sure he is the number 1 in the world But overall he is more of a wild animal than a Lab / Beagle etc … and as a result we always need to treat him with respect / care. He needs a garden / space to run around in. We read a lot about the breed before we bought him. Everything that is on the internet about the breed (Shiba Inu) is % true. Their character, how they act, that they need to be on a leash … everything. We have had him fixed, so this calmed him down a lot. He is a healthy dog, been well looked after and in good health with a full passport / vaccinations etc. If you have anyone that would like to meet Wagyu, let us know and we can arrange any time. Above all else, we want to know that he has gone to a family that will love him as much as we have. It is a very hard decision to put Wagyu up for adoption.

She is timid but gentle and very intelligent. She thinks the best place in the world is to be near her human at all times. She will insist on joining you when you watch TV, use the computer, cook, use the toilet, shower and will even try to help you choose the clothes to wear. She looks like a Siamese cat, but she is a local street-born, complete with a double-kink tail. Also like a Siamese cat, she has a wide vocabulary of sounds from cute raspy squeaks to out-loud cries. Her purr motor is loud and turns on very easily. Shiro has a silky soft coat and greatly enjoys playing with her toys and getting her fur brushed. 11 March . Rescued from the streets and was covered with filth, car grease and was mostly skin and bones. 12 March . Shiro was taken to the vet where she was de-wormed and de-fleaed and given antibiotics. She weighed g on that day and pronounced to be a girl and 2 and half months old. 30 March . Shiro was given her first vaccination and was de-wormed again. Her weight has shot up to 1.25kg. The vet thought that she is closer to 3 and half months old at this point. 29 Apr . Done with the second jab and she weighed 1.75kg. 27 May . Done with the third and final vaccination jab. Her weight at this point is 2.15kg. 3 June . Spayed. The adopter shall receive her vaccination card and medical records from the vet. Current diet: * Dr. Gary's Best Breed kibbles. Taste of the Wild cat kibbles. * 2 meals per day of fresh raw chicken/beef pieces mixed with either one of these canned food – Fancy Feast, Monge and Fussie Cat. Or mixed with bonito/sardine flakes (the type sold in Japanese food section) * Favourite treat – washed and blanched ikan bilis mixed with raw chicken. * Also eats raw chicken neck chopped to small kitty bite sizes. Given no more than once a week as it can cause constipation. * She enjoys Farm Fresh plain yoghurt. * As treats, she likes Greenies Roasted Chicken Dental Cat and Greenies Smartbites Skin & Fur Salmon. Cat litter – Shiro currently uses Cat's Best by ÖkoPlus. She loves clean litter boxes and is obsessed with how the flushing toilet works. Suitable adopter – a person who can: * Give Shiro safe indoor environment. * Offer a ""safe room"" to slowly introduce Shiro to her new home. The room must be big enough to put in her litter box, a pet carrier with her toys and bowls of food and water. This is important to ensure she does not freak out when she sees so many new things and people. The room could be a spare toilet or a large pet cage or even the bedroom so that she can sleep with you at night. * Ensure that Shiro is kept indoors always. * Put up with her crying and hiding during the intro period. Shiro is a shy timid cat and she will hide and probably cry for the first few days in her new home. Please be understanding and spend as much time as possible with her to gain her trust and love. * Give Shiro a companion. Shiro hates to be alone. The companion could be a younger cat or a human. *Provide her with nutritous meals suitable for a cat. NOT suitable adopter – a home that: * Leaves Shiro many hours alone. * Has an ""open door” policy – Shiro cannot survive outdoors. To be outdoors, a cat has to have some tough badass attitude, and Shiro has none of it. She is just a complete sweetheart who wants manja and sayang. Please email or text me why you want to adopt Shiro and introduce who you are.",281618ba5,26,3

At night, I went to the location to meet up with Geetha (the person who posted online in several animal rescue Facebook) to take the dog home first. We managed to get her into a cage by midnight - she was feisty and tried to bite us. She couldn't walk by then. The next morning, my bro and I took this dog to the vet and was told that the dog had broken spine that caused the hind legs to be unresponsive. We were told to put her down to avoid suffering. We didn't want to give up on her when she still tried to bite us whenever we touched her back. She still wanted to live. We took her to another vet and had scanned - she had dislocated spine, not broken, there was some nerves still as her toes did pull back when the vet pinched hard (really hard). She had lots of maggots, some were plucked by the 1st vet place, some by me (eee) and by the 2nd vet place. We used Magtox spray on her, applied med and cleaned the wound around the back of the neck. 2nd vet suspected her neck was chained or pulled with sth tight and the dislocated spine was from longer duration than the accident timing. Now her neck wound has healed with fur covering the area. Her hind legs are not moving mostly but when we pinch her toes, she would pull back her legs. Since June, she has been and is currently fostered at KL Pooch Rescue, Cheras to get swimming (once a week) and physiotherapy. I've been taking her to acupuncture sessions a few time per month to help with the pain and hopefully, she can walk soon. She is not easy to take care of.

Condition: Healthy and Pregnant (Probably will deliver in early May). Believed that this is not the first time she is pregnant. Characteristics: Adorable. Soft. Very affectionate dan sangat manja. Likes to purr a lot. Likes to roll her self on the floor:) Sangat comel bila dia golek-golekkan badan dia atas lantai;) Likes to clean herself frequently. Even with a bulging stomach, she is still a playful mama and like to play:) Why she needs to be adopted asap: Cause the Cat Catcher of my hostel block has started their cat cat catching operation and they may take Mama Kin away to unknown-unsafe place..worse, according to the Cat Catcher,the cats that they have captured will be taken to the zoo negara. Mama Kin's story: Mama Kin is a stray cat that came to my hostel block about two months ago, out of nowhere, right after Mega and her kids have left us. When we started to approach Mama Kin, we noticed that she is an adult cat and she is also pregnant. Without any bias or judgment, yet with with warm hearts, we welcome her to our lives and to this hostel block. Kami namakan dia Mama Kin sebab kaki dia ada 'white spots' that make her looks as if dia pakai stokin;) She is a pretty, adorable and cute pregnant mummy cat. She has been a very good and affectionate cat too. Dia sangat manja. She likes to purr a lot every time I play with her, caress her head, stroke her fur and give her some food. Despite the fact that we love having her around, we know that ""some people"" don't like it. Dan ""some people"" yang dimaksudkan di sini ialah ""the hostel management people"". Just like other cases of cats in this hostel block, we do fear that Mama Kin will be taken away by the Cat Catcher assigned by the hostel management sooner or later. Kalau kucing-kucing ini diambil dan dibawa ke tempat seperti SPCA ke, saya tak kisah. But the Cat Catcher once told me that the cats that he has captured will be brought to zoo negara or somewhere unknown. I totally don't want these cats to be taken to zoo negara or anywhere else that's not safe. Therefore, me and my friends realize that one day we need to find Mama Kin a new owner and release her from this ""cat hater"" place. So, we at first plan to give her away for adoption after she has given birth. Unfortunately, the day that we fear has come. This morning, the Cat Catcher came to my hostel and he and the team searched high and low for any cats, just any cats whether it's the one that has been neutered or not. However, thank God, Alhamdulillah and I'm so grateful that some of my friends who are also cat lovers managed to act quickly and managed to save and hide other cats in some rooms and Mama Kin is now hiding in my room. And this is not the end. They will come again soon cause they know, the cats that they are searching for are not captured today. With all this panic moment and in such dangerous state, I think I can't wait until Mama Kin has delivered. I can't wait after her delivery. It's going to take longer time and her life is 'at stake' now, if I may put it that way. So, I'm putting up Mama Kin's profile in here, so that anybody who's a true cat lover, kind-hearted, considerate and caring out there could have the heart to adopt her. Please... Yes, she is pregnant. And the person who would love to adopt her must be the one who is prepared and ready for new comers. If that person doesn't plan to have them all, perhaps you could be patient for awhile and later, you could give them away for adoption once the kittens are big enough. I'm searching for someone who really really appreciates cats whether they are adults or kittens. Why I say this is because, when I 'advertise' Mega and her kitten not long ago,I found out some people like to have the kittens yet abandon the mother. There was this one couple who intended to adopt Mega and one of her kittens. Tapi this couple told me that they live in an apartment. So what they plan to do is to keep the kitten but put Mega downstairs with other stray cats. Kalau macam tu, apa guna saya iklankan untuk Mega di'adopt'. Baik saya 'buang' saja Mega ke zoo negara seperti yang dilakukan oleh Cat Catcher di hostel block saya ni. So, basically, all I'm asking and hoping for is to have a cat lover who is responsible and caring to take good care of the pregnant and adorable Mama Kin which deserves to feel loved and be happy in a safer place, as soon as possible. That's all. Please... Thank you=)",b6fbfa344,12,2

Being a cat and all animal lover I thought poor thing, it must have been frightened or felt uncomfortable where she “lived” so decided to come have her kittens in my place. I also assumed she belonged to one of my many neighbours who apparently are “cat lovers or owners”….. the ones who let their cats run about and poo all over the condo area stinking up the area. Anyway I have provided mother and kittens with a safe and clean place to stay. The mother comes and goes, presumably to her owner or to look for food and do her business. Assuming she “belongs” to one of my neighbours I have put up signs on all blocks with pictures attached for the owner to come collect their bundle of fun, also saying “if you don’t I will have offer them up for adoption and/or send them all to SPCA. To date I have not had any replies to my posters. Lately the mother cat does not come back as often as she should and I’m doing my best to “feed” them. I never planned to keep them but just give them temporary shelter till someone claims them or the mother sorts herself out and returns to her own accommodation/owner or starts paying rent :-) Now I offer them to any cat lover/owners. Next step will be to SPCA or any other animal shelter. Attached are some pictures of these adorable kittens.

Though I personal understand that chances of him being adopted is as close as 0, but deep down inside me I still hope someone who will have a big heart for him. Ninja is not special or pretty, but in my eyes, he is not any lesser than other prettier cats. He is 6-year-old now, and has never parted with me as he was born in my wardrobe and been with me since then. His mom was a stray that I used to feed and without me knowing she creeped into my wardrobe and gave birth to 3 beautiful babies. Unfortunately his mom passed away after 2 weeks, sent to the vet when found she Ill but was too late to treat. I bottle fed him since the day his mom crossed the bridge. I have 4 cats of my own and I'm being relocated to SG and could only bring 2 cats with me due to circumstances. I would eventually follow my husband to Australia in a few years time from SG and can't afford the expensive pet relocating cost. It kills me to pick which 2 among 4 of them. I'm brining the oldest and Ninja's sister (ex-sporo survival) simply because 1 being the oldest and the other one being an ex sporo patient. Ninja is a very quiet and independent cat. He doesn't like to be held much or pat. It takes a really big heart to love him unconditionally as he is not the huggable type. He needs a permanent home with an owner who loves him despite being a little too 'cool'. I hope someone out there will have a space at home and a big heart to take him in and love him.

Around 7.30am, I went back to the place to find them still there and I asked around if they have seen the mother cat but they said no where to be found.

She loves chest-snuggles and touching noses with her people (although her long whiskers almost always get to you first, lol). ♥ MiraBelle has had her 1st vaccination, has been de-wormed (twice) and given FrontLine (for flea prevention). ***PLEASE READ (NOTE FOR ADOPTERS)***: - MiraBelle must be kept INDOORS at all times. - Adopters must SPAY her at the right age. - MiraBelle must be continued on Orijen cat food/kibbles (she needs a high-meat diet for proper immune-health). Please drop me an email or call if you feel that you may be just the right person for this girl. Thank you! :)",19d8b1d8e,10,2

He's a very friendly and happy boy who loves being petted and hugged, and gets along easily with people and other pets. He's also toilet trained to do his business indoors (on a pan) although he will prefer to do his business on grass if he can. Once he trusts you, if you go out for walks, he will follow you around without a need a for lease and will not disturb other passerbys (unless they disturb him, which is a normal reaction for dogs). He knows his name and usually comes when you call, even stands without running when showered. Romeo would make a wonderful companion for families with children or anyone who does not want an overly active dog. He's spayed and had his first vaccination. He has also proven himself to have a strong will to live and enjoy life because early in January , he was found (by me) lying on the street, completely paralysed and injured quite badly. He had gotten into a bad dog fight, suspected to be over a female in heat (hence the name, Romeo!). At the time, Romeo could not move his whole body and only could slightly move his head and needed help even to eat. During that time, he proved his intelligence by toilet training himself to go to the right pee/poo spot in my house just by observing my other dogs! Even when he couldn't stand properly, he would crawl over to the pee pan and do his business. After a few months of physiotherapy and love, thankfully now he can walk and run very well, although not perfectly and he also cannot jump (e.g. over drains, etc). Even with his limitations, he loves every chance he gets to go out and walk around, while at home, he will come to you for love and attention, giving you a silly happy derp face that you can't help but fall in love with! :) By the way, just because he cannot move completely normally does not mean he will not defend you and your house, as he will bark at potential danger, just like any loyal dog would! This happy boy who has a second chance at life is looking for a loving adopter with a big heart to give him a good home! Location in Subang Jaya",19af88854,10,4

Kitten must follow up with the vaccinations. 3. Kitten must be spayed when reaches 6 months old. Rescuer Note: Kitten is not ready to be neutered yet until he/she is 6 months old. It is very important to neuter him/her when he/she is ready, as this will prevent him/her from getting lost. The male cat will wander off your home to find any female cat on heat, while the female cat will wander off when on heat, and will get pregnant. Risk of losing your cat is very high if you don't neuter them. And also your cat may risk injury due to fighting or your furniture will risk damage as well, as un-neutered cat is more aggressive.",01ac09f2a,5,3

Opposite the street that she lived in was another female dog and her puppies. Unfortunately this dog died and Sassy decided to feed this new litter of puppies. She was also very protective of this litter of puppies that she whined whenever my dad and I tried to take them away (so sweet right?). She managed to nurture 2 puppies back to health but the rest died. We took her in after a while and she was an amazing pet. She is so tame and was able to learn the rules in our house in no time (much faster than my own dogs). She is loving and a wonderful guard dog. Unfortunately we have to give all our dogs a way.

Kiki is the biggest of them four and he is the laid-back brother he can fall asleep anywhere and anytime even when his head was on top of the tap. Eat and sleep is Kiki's motto. However when challenged, Kiki will step up and protect his sisters and stand in front and bark. Lala is a feisty one she barks the loudest yet she is a softie inside.

Wawa is the prettiest and smallest in size but she gives you a good fight and will be good in guarding your house with her high pitched bark. Wawa looks the most different from all of them and her coat is similar to a Doberman. Yaya is the most animated and active of them all. She is keen to explore and the first to warm up to humans after they were rescued. Yaya is the most intelligent of them all as she picks up cue faster than her siblings.

GERBERA is a tropical plant of the daisy family, native to Asia and Africa, with large brightly colored flowers. Just like this little kitten that we are fostering - Gerbera, she is as beautiful as the flower. Gerbera was rescued months ago at a food court, she was only a 2 months old baby during that time. Poor little baby was hiding under a car and meowing loudly seeking for help as there were a group of excited dogs wanted to hunt her and they kept running and waiting around the car. With help of some kind people there, we managed to shooed those doggie away and brought her home. Gerbera loves a lot to have companion and friends, she do not like much to be cuddled but she will always stay beside you and ask for a pat and ""massage"", she lovesss a lot when people sayang her. Gerbera is always happy when we're back home, she will always purr when we're at her side. But Gerbera has a habit and we do not know why she has such habit..most of the time when we stand near the window she will quickly run towards the window and climb on the window grill, as if like she's making a performance and telling us that she's good on this (we tried to stop her at the beginning but still..she want to let us know that she's good at this..a spider-cat Gerbera! :P) Gerbera behaves very good on bathing time but she do not like to share her food and toy with her friends. She can eat together with friends if in different bowl but when they re eating same bowl of food, she will be very nervous and lift up her front paw to stop anyone from nearing the bowl but of course she do not bite or hurt anyone.. Interested to adopt? Please kindly read our requirements: - Always keep cat indoor all the time - Agree to bring her for yearly vaccination - Provide balanced meals and fresh water all the time - Allow for home visit - Love and treat her like your own precious family members Please give a home to Gerbera ♥",d8715d47e,6,4

Thank you! : ) Aura & Solar were rescued as part of a 4-kitten litter from a backlane opposite my home on 20 August . and after ensuring that they are in good health and well socialised after almost a month of fostering them, the 2 kittens are now ready to be rehomed. It's difficult to tell them apart as their coat colour and pattern are exactly the same but looking at their eyes, you will be able to differentiate both the kittens. - They have dewormed by a vet on 21 August (RM September (RM12) at a total cost of RM30. - They have been treated with Frontline spray on 21 August to protect against fleas for a month. - I'm feeding them with Vetri-DMG liquid supplement at 0.5mL twice a day. - Their weights are 0.55kg & 0.65kg as at 12 September . - They're eating Earthborn premium dry kitten kibbles. - They drink water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled twice a day to condition the kittens to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage their health and shorten their life. - They're toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using Ever Clean premium litter. - Their poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as their overall health. - Aura & Solar have been vaccinated on 12 September at a cost of RM85. - Aura & Solar's behaviour is perfect as pets as they're completely domesticated, playful, curious and affectionate. They would purr happily when held. They are friendly to other cats and kittens (but of course, they must accept them too) as they're well-socialised. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The kittens must be adopted together because they keep each other company (and out of trouble). 2) The adopter must be a Malaysian. However, I will consider an expatriate adopter if you can provide assurances for Their future when you return to your home country. 3) They must be kept indoors at all times. 4) Vaccinate them yearly to protect against diseases. 5) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 6) The RM adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only cover their vaccination & deworming costs. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. It would be appreciated if the adopter is on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on Aura & Solar. If possible, please adopt Aura & Solar at Sunsuria Avenue (same building as Tune Hotel near Sunway Giza Mall), Kota Damansara on a weekend as I'm working on weekdays. If you're interested to adopt Aura & Solar, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience. Please don't just provide a phone number because I won't call/sms and prefer to correspond by e-mail first. Looking forward to hearing from you! :)",2278114,13,1

Oh, and hazel green eyes to die for! Rescued on a rainy Christmas afternoon at a street junction in Petaling (Friday). After a brief moment of petting, the darling decided simply to 'adopt' us, she kept tagging along wherever we went. (It's like she knew it HAD to be me, that i'd finally give in to such temptations and take her with me). I can be such a kitty magnet at times... This lady is extremely sweet and manja. I don't think she's had much attention from anyone during her life on the streets. Thus, i'd prefer it if she's able to go to a new home where she'd have other kitts to play around with...either that or lots and LOTS of human attention :] She's able to take solids already (currently on RC Kitten diet) and is clever with the litterbox.

Blue kitten!'

She was locked up and fostered in only a tiny toilet as her ""home"" for 4 months. This is where she ate/slept/poo/pee-ed. She lived with near zero outside world or human contact and this eventually took a toll on her confidence. ♥ Emmie was later rescued (with mange, fleas, and all sorts of physical problems). The biggest damage of all was her broken spirit...she had little to no trust towards humans. -------------------------------------------------- ♥ Emmie has been under proper foster care and all her medical problems have been resolved. She has proven herself to be a very curious and eager girl! She loves to be pet, asks for more, enjoys treats, play and her evening walks. She gets better the more time you spend with her! ♥ Emmie is friendly towards other dogs (only needs a few days to adjust). She is VERY alert and started barking at strangers within just one day of staying at her foster home. She will make a good watch-dog (not a guard dog). ♥ Emmie is a near hassle free girl to care for. :) She is independent, un-demanding, not hyper and never fussy about food. She also knows how to use the grass patch as her ""potty"", no messes. ♥ Emmie is looking for a loving new family who can give her the time, patience and love which she was deprived of as a puppy. -------------------------------------------------- Please read (Note for Adopters): - Emmie should not be leashed or caged (unless it's for very temporary needs). She is a freedom loving girl. Please drop me a call or email if you feel that you may be just the right person to give this darling a second chance. Thank you!",7390b70c5,7,3

If anyone out there who is looking for an active & talkative kitten, this is the kitten for you. He is very attached to humans as he sits by the gate & watches us whole day long when he is not busy playing with dried leaves. Kindly contact Yee at if you are interested.",d63321570,2,3

I guess Brave was not meant to end his life there, he managed to meow softly which somehow caught my attention. I quickly picked him up and was shocked to see that Brave was so skinny and could barely walk. Brave's body was so cold and his eyes were half opened. Without any hesitation, I used a thick towel to wrap him up and tried to hand feed him with some wetfood,he refused to eat, fed him with some milk and water, he refused to drink, Brave was simply too weak to eat and drink. Brave was infected by a virus similar to that of parvo virus in a dog. That night, Brave was just lying and closed his eyes with heavy breath and i thought that he might not be able to make it to the next day. However, in the middle of the night, i heard a soft meow, it was Brave ! he was meowing to me ! he managed to raise up his little head eventhough he still could not stand up and walk. Immediately, i fed him some milk and water and he drank ! i monitored Brave's condition throughout the night (he was having severe diarrhea as well) and rushed him to the vet, Dr. Tan (2nd chance panel vet) the next morning. Dr. Tan said by looking at Brave's terrible condition and based on her experience, normally kitten infected with this kind of virus and with such a low body temperature as well as severe diarrhea, Brave had a very low chance to pull through. Brave was hospitalised and continue to be monitored and i, already prepared to receive call from the Dr. Tan anytime about the bad news on Brave, However, Brave has such a strong will to live, he began to perk up the next day, he can stand up and walk, he started to eat and drink by himself ! Yesterday, i dropped by at the clinic and Dr. Tan said that Brave's temperature has gone back to normal despite a bit of a diarrhoea. Brave not only ate and drank on his own, he even walked out from the cage and greeted me with a loud meow ! After a while, he started to groom himself ! What a joy! So, this is a wonderful and happy story about Brave and i hope that someone can foster Brave or better still, adopt him ! because Brave definitely deserves to be loved, doesn't he ? I hope that someone is kind enough to foster him. if he is not adopted, at least he is under the good hands of the fosterer and until the time that he is totally recovered and strong enough, i have to put Brave back to his colony. i hope Brave is fit and strong enough to be a community cat at my condo. Brave is really a miracle to me, he really wants to survive and he does ! Try to look at the pictures that i attached, his eyes are full of fighting spirit..........

Thank you VERY VERY MUCH in advance for reading this listing and forwarding it to your friends and family. Apologies in advance if the Terms and Conditions set out below are a little ""harsh"", but I have gotten too many calls/ responses from very rude people, calls from people who do not even know that it is NOT OK to call people at 2am, etc. Also, our intentions are very simple: WE JUST WANT TO FIND GOOD HOMES FOR THE PUPPIES. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TERMS AND CONDITIONS:- (1) Please DO NOT ask me what breed these are, they are stray puppies. If you want a Golden Retriever or Rottweiler, please visit your neighbourhood pet shop. (2) These are large breed dogs, they will grow into a standard size dog. They are not toy dogs, hence not suitable for those who live in an apartment/ condominium. (3) Please DO NOT delete my all these information and just forward the photos. I get too many people asking me for information which I have already given in the first place. (4) This listing is dated 8-June-. This is to manage your expectations on whether the puppy you fell in love with is still available. (5) We reside in Seri Kembangan, KL, near the Astro office (there is someone at home 95% of the time). Please only contact us if you are willing to come to our house to pick the puppies up. It will also mean that we get a chance to meet the new ""owners"" to see whether they are suitable for the puppies. We want to find good homes for the puppies and ensure that they do not get kicked out into the streets once they are grown and lose their cuteness. (6) If you and your family members are interested to adopt, please get agreement from all members before contacting us. We do not want them to get kicked out into the streets because of one of your family member dislike them. Those who are interested and agreeable to the above 6 points, please read on:- (7) The puppies are free, but as a gesture of sincerity, we hope you can donate RM50 to either SPCA or PAWS. You can pass us the money when you pick up the puppy. We will donate on your behalf and mail you the receipt in your name. If for any reason you cannot afford this token donation, please let us know the reason why, we are very reasonable people. (8) You will need to let us know some basic information about yourself as follows (do include this info in your email):- - Name - Where you live and type of house - Who you live with - Some history on whether you have owned any dogs before (9) No reservations please. First come first served. (10) If your friend/ cousin/ girlfriend/ uncle/ husband/ aunt etc is the one interested to adopt, please ask him/ her to contact us directly. It is easier for all this way.

But can only stay there til the end o this week!! :( (IF THIS IS YOUR DOG CONTACT ME ASAP) My friend found this poor doggy outside her mother-in-law'a house area. He was just lying there in the muddy ground, and was quite weak to stand up, but was mild mannered. My friend never handled a dog before and though she was a little afraid, she has been feeding him and giving him water for the 2 days that he was there. They did not know who is the owner but he sure was either abandoned or somehow dragged himself? It seems unlikely that he is just lost when his two hind legs are too weak to stand for more than 6 seconds. She called me for help as I had some experience. While trying to figure out what to do, a kind lady with her husband who had seen the dog before came back to help. In the end I managed to convince my mum for the dog to stay just overnight til the couple and I bring ""Bobby"" to the vet the next day coz it was already late evening. Her husband and the lady herself have helped bringing the dog to the vet, as well as financially giving as much as they can. BUT THEY CANT FOSTER/ADOPT THE DOG because they were not used to dogs as well them being muslims. >> Please do contact me via whatsapp if you can foster the dog. He is really sweet, really!! A bit of a lazy whiny bum, but he is gentle. But does not do well with cats, mind you. Overall, he is a good dog.

He enjoys climbing up onto your shoulder to sniffle your hair and nibble your ear. He grew up with 4 bigger brothers and could not compete with them for milk and space while baby. So he was always the smallest and sickly one. His right eye still looks wonky due to his sickly babyhood. The vet says that he might out grow it as he matures. But if not, it can be corrected (but not necessary). But he is healthy and active now in spite of his wonky right eye. In fact, to make up for his small size, he has grown a big ""I-can-do-it"" attitude and is often the leader of his bigger brothers showing them new places to explore and new games to play. And because of his sickly babyhood, he had developed a very positive outlook in life - whatever happens he will still go, ""Yay! Happy, happy."" He is a well-socialized intelligent kitty because he got the double privilege of growing up with brothers and a mother cat and got regular daily hand-feeding by various kind people since babyhood. So he gets along cheerfully with cats and humans. He loves to play with the kids in the neighbourhood. Born on 15 Nov , he is brother to Caramel and Muffin: And brother to Cupcake and Cookie: It would be ideal if he could be adopted together with Cupcake and Cookie because they are now very close to each other. Some important info: * Checked by vet and de-worm treatment was done on 6 December and 6 Jan . * Vaccinated on 20 Jan - 1st jab. * Vaccinated on 24 Feb - 2nd jab * Next vaccination jab is on 24 March . * On 6 Jan - he weighs over g.

He wears a very dirty blue collar, with no I.D tag. According to those shop owners and some workers there, he has been wandering around the area for the past 2 days. Looked very hungry so we tried feeding him some corn that i had bought, but he was very timid, he will not approach the food if we put the it on our palm, so we leave it on the floor and move away, and he ate them. When people go near him, he will run away too. There are many cars in that area, he can get knock down very easily. We managed to get him and send him to a dog shelter in Cheras. He is not aggressive at all, looks timid and insecure and did not make any noise (no barking). Unfortunately this dog shelter in Cheras is also very full, i begged them and they agree to temporary shelter him when I go look for fosterer or adopter. This poor boy looks very unkept right now, but I believe he will looks better after grooming. I know many will not give this boy a second look, but I beg you to please give this boy a chance to be loved. Please adopt over buying.",7a54b760e,3,2

Aslan has been de-flead and de-wormed (is currently too young to be vaccinated). Please drop me a call or e-mail if interested. Details on your past experience with cats will be much appreciated :) Thank you!",536af3840,4,1

She was a lone pup most likely abandoned. Hailey was close to death when she was rescued. Severely malnourished and anemic she could barely stand. She had major hookworm infestation and the worse case of fleas I had ever seen. It was heartbreaking to see such a tiny little dog endure so much. Her blood count was so low that a blood transfusion was needed. But like her vet says..Hailey is a fighter and a survivor! She was such a good patient throughout her treatment and rehabilitation. It was so easy to administer her meds and when she got her appetite back she would eat anything I fed her..no complaints, no rejection . Thankfully, she is now a happy and healthy girl. She is also very intelligent. She learned the commands sit and down in a day and would go back to her cage when she's instructed to. Although it breaks my heart to give her up for adoption, I feel she deserves much more than what a condo habitat can offer. Hailey received her first vaccination a few days ago and is due for her 2nd in a month. Her adoption is only open to genuine dog lovers who will take her in as part of the family .

With broken hind legs. Probably knocked by a vehicle. He was crying but no passer-by cared to rescue him. My friends from the neigbourhood and I decided to check him out after hearing his cry for a couple of days and noticed that he was an abandoned puppy with serious injuries. We quickly raised funds ourselves and sent him to the vet for operations. Now, he is as healthy and lively as any other puppy. Soon after he was healed, we put his up for adoption as my friend's parents strongly against her keeping ""Oreo"" as pet. Finally, a kind lady adopted ""Oreo"" but only for 2 weeks. She surrendered Oreo to us saying the dog is just not right for her and Oreo has lost because she was careless . Finally my friend get to found ""Oreo"" in some where. Now, we have to put Oreo up for adoption again. I really hope that a kind person with love and care for animals will adopt Oreo and give him a comfortable live. He has gone through many hardship. From being abandoned to severe injuries, then adopted to be abandoned again. If you are touched and would love to keep Oreo, a lively and active puppy of 3 years old ,please call at Shirmy or Yeng Tian . Every dog, including Oreo deserves a second chance. * Please note that the photography of Oreo was done FOC by a kind photographer, Andrew 洋葱头, who pitied the plight of Oreo",3b4a987ba,3,4

Tame cos I've been playing with them to let them get used to human contact. A bit shy at first but goes soft and lazy when you give them a good cuddle. Very very healthy and will make good pets. Litter trained in the backyard and feeding on kibbles and able to drink from water bowl. I would prefer them to be adopted as a pair, and the other with an owner who already owns a cat or kitten. Or better still, all three one go! :D Please text or email to me and I'll reply to arrange for viewing. Adopters should have a commitment on following compulsory requirements before making enquiry. 1) vaccination (initial 3 vaccinations and yearly follow up) 2) spay/neuter by 5 months of age 3) lots of tender loving care Thanks for viewing their profile.",99c2ceb33,15,1

Raised as indoor cats (litter trained) but loves the occasional outdoors after a few minutes of sniffing around to get familiar with the surroundings. The short-tailed brown cat is named Sleepwalker & shortened to Sleepy & shortened again to Cheepee :) Cheepee loves belly-rubs, playing chase with his toy mouse & gives this short cute acknowledgement when you call him while he's napping. The long-tailed black cat is named Munch Munch & shortened to Munchee & interchangeably called Wer-Wer (pronounced something similar to 'wear') coz he tends to meow that way :) Munchee loves the outdoors & chasing lizards & giving head-butts & loves taking a nap on my legs. Both also loves playing chase with a feather-stick, going round & round & round. I'm looking for cat-lovers who can give them a loving home. Their basic cat stuff & toys will be passed along as well. I just need someone who really loves cats and will take good care of them. Please let me know if you or someone you know would want to adopt them. My email: TQ",c5b782f4e,2,3

We are forced to give her up for adoption. Being said, there are also another 2 cats, Molly (3yr, female, neutered mother of Zee) and nova (male, 4 months old). As for Zee, he is 2yr, male, spayed. I wish both Molly and Zee can be adopted together, due to their relation and the time spent together, they very much rely on one another. As for Nova, he is rescued on November , so he is still a new family member to Molly and Zee, nevertheless, they got along very well. All 3 of them are potty trained, they are also able to share food together. They have almost never shown any aggression towards each other.

We are forced to give her up for adoption. Being said, there are also another 2 cats, Zee (2yr, male, neutered son of molly) and nova (male, 4 months old). As for Molly, she is 3yr, female, spayed. I wish both Molly and Zee can be adopted together, due to their relation and the time spent together, they very much rely on one another. As for Nova, he is rescued on November , so he is still a new family member to Molly and Zee, nevertheless, they got along very well. All 3 of them are potty trained, they are also able to share food together. They have almost never shown any aggression towards each other. I wish the next adopter is knowledgeable about cat behavior, as it will definitely require some period of time for the cats to adapt to the new environment, financially independent, best if your are staying in a landed property.

When we pick her up she already had a major broken front leg which we had no choice but to amputate it to save her. Its been 3 weeks since we took her in and she is now doing very well. Her stitches has also been removed. A special thing about this cat is she is so manja and love throwing her entire body to your feet and sleeps there :D. She is really adorable. We cannot keep her because we already have 2 cats and we are also trying to avoid our neighbour from making complaints. We seek your help to give this cat a home. She is really a good company.

They are probably 2-3 months old, I can't really tell, very friendly and playful, needless to say, extremely adorable. Their mother is owned by a security guard and is tethered to a little guard station in Bandar Seri Damansara area. She gave birth to 12 puppies and the security guard did his best to feed and take care of them, but only managed to get 5 adopted so far. Leaving 7 puppies with their mama, mostly unsupervised, by the side of a street. They have reached the age where they are getting more and more curious everyday and are starting to venture a little bit farther from their mama each day. Other than the obvious danger, outdoor is no place for these puppies to grow up (with the constant rain etc, they will also need to be dewormed, vaccinated, and spayed/neutered). We bought a 30 pound bag of good quality dog food for the guard to lighten his financial burden of having to feed these many puppies and to give the nursing mama some much needed nutrients, but it will not last long. A friend who lives nearby has promised to check on them and give them treats when he jogs/drives by. We have also left a few toys for them to hopefully keep them entertained and keep them away from the street and from wandering too far away. If you are in the area, or know anyone who is thinking of getting a pet, or have connections to rescue groups, please share the pictures of these puppies and help them find their permanent/foster homes. The security guard can be found at Jalan Damar SD15/3 guard house and can be reached at . Rescues are the best breed!

This poor fellow was mearly 3 weeks old and looked very sickly.I took him to PAWS so that he could be adopted. Despite having to pay RM50/- he will be put to sleep. I changed my mind n took him home. Only recently do I kn how to put pets for adoption in the net. The first meal that I gave him was simply a meal he had not had for days. He ate... n ate... n ate .... till his stomach looks like a barrel. He is with me since then and now he is one year old n three weeks (I suppose). He started to be aggressive as he matured. Even after spaying him for a month now he is aggressive. He would attack other adult male cats when threatened. If I managed to separate them he would turn his attack towards other female cats nearby n if I pull him away his eyes would focus on my arm n hand and will want to bite me. (He has bitten me before).Well this morning again it happened I quickly put him in my room n took another cat out, he came running after us n I manage to close the rm door. I am really frightened if he bites me again. He needs a loving home that has no other cats to be threatened. He is a darling to kittens n even allows the kitten to suck milk but will really put up a fight with any male cats. I really can't handle him any longer as I do bring in rescued cats to my place. I hope that he finds a good loving home with no other adult cats. By.. n by if I hv no other options I will put him out as strays (he will injure other stray cats then) or put him to sleep (thats my vry last resort which I am not too keen). Pls gv suggestions or advise as what I shld do. The best is hv him adopted to a loving home without other cats around.

Serious adopters please contact me. ***Priority will be given to those that want to adopt both. Thanks! :) 2 Fun, Affectionate Male Cats with Tons of Personality Seek a Good, Loving Home Good things come in two! Barney - Grey and White with Raccoon tail (10months) Chubby, cuddly, half-Persian cat. Extremely affectionate, loves attention. Will come when called and will automatically roll over to get his belly rubbed when you walk up to him. Will sometimes chase you when you run. Loves to eat, follow you around the house, sleep in cool/dark places (finds the best hiding place), wrestle and chase Hobbes. Also very paternal and loving with the little one, never fails to give him a good cleaning and a hug. And when he can’t find him, he’ll roam the house calling out for him (has the funniest meow). He’s a morning cat – will wake you up by snuggling his nose in your face. Hobbes – Orange and White(7months) Very curious, cheeky, active little kitten. He’s the adventurous, cunning one who will explore everything. You will be amazed at his zest for life. Has a handsome white tuft of fur under his chin, looks very regal when he sits. Loves plastic (sleeping on it, playing with it) and loves the sun (will snooze all day right in the beams of the sun). Absolutely loves balls of paper – can play for hours with one (not kidding). Finds the most random, funniest places to lay on – handbag, plastic bag, bowl, etc. Always jumps on Barney and starts wrestling him. He may be little but he’s got a lot of spark in him. Independent at times, but will always give in and seek the comfort of your lap. They’re both interesting cats with their own personalities and are extremely loving and gentle with humans. Have never scratched or bitten ever. No problem with strangers at all. Potty-trained. Very well-fed and healthy. It truly breaks my heart to part with them, but I have no choice as I’ll be moving out of the country. Please do consider adopting them as a pair as they really love each other. But if you have no choice either, you can choose to adopt one. Call or SMS me at if you’re interested.",7a7835503,7,4

Mei Xin jie jie is a very sweet girl and she will be playing with me when I get to my new home.I love her too! That's why mummy decided to let me live with them. _______________________________________________ Faith was a little tiny puppy when I found her wandering around.She had a bald tip tail and hind legs and could not walk properly thus we believed she was ill-treated from home and had no proper nutrition. So we brought her home and sent her to the vet. The vet said she was about 1 month plus old then. She was given medicine and dewormed but not heart guard as she was too tiny. She's now healed with LOTS OF HAIR!! and very healthy. We are a couple staying in a rented home with neighbours who complain about our dogs let free in the compound.Therefore Faith lives in a cage whenever we're off to work and out of home. I am now not working but will soon be working again. Also, due to our financial status, we're not able to to provide proper nutrition to all the animals thus we have decided to let go Faith the youngest dog which needs the nutrition and a proper growing envinroment most. Faith is toilet trained and she's fleas/ticks/mites free. TOILET TRAINED - She might let go at the wrong place due to new environment. ------------------------------------------------- Dear Wonderful pet lovers, I have received many calls regarding Faith this whole day and am happy to know that there are so many of you out there who are interested in adopting her. There's a question I must answer to every phone call and I should state it here clearly. YES,ADOPTING FAITH IS FREE! YOUR PRICE TO PAY IS TO GIVE MY LITTLE MONSTER PROPER CARE AND A LOVING HOME. Please also note that Faith is a growing puppy therefore she's very playful and active - running around.This is the only thing I am worried about.

Yes all his stuff will be provided: -his favourite kibbles -his favourite wet food -his favourite treats -his towel, shampoo, conditioner, brush -his vitamins Anything he needs i will provide and i usually send him for full grooming once in 2 months or once a month depending on the weather. Like now its blazing hot so i will send him for grooming before giving him to the fosterer. If there is anyone interested let me know and of course i would need to scan through the fosterer as Zorro means a lot to me. If you are planning to get a dog for a pet but not sure if you can handle well this is your chance to have a pooch at ur place temporary to see if dogs suitable for u.. Zorro is a sweet dainty little dog.. He can be quite shy with strangers but once he is used to u, he can be very hyper when he wants to play. Though he is 5 years old, he can still behave like an excited puppy. He loves jumping around and skipping..He loves to 'lepak' in a small space like under his cage or the washing machine or the couch. He is very alert when i call for him and he knows quite a number of commands like sit, down , stay , no , in etc but his signature trick is ""malu"" and that's when he'll cover his eyes with his paws.Since he is a smart fella, i believe there are still room for him to learn new things.. Whenever i take him for a walk i dont need a leash bcoz he wont stray far for me and it will always be him who wants to go back inside. He is only meant for serious adopter who is a genuine animal lover looking for a lifetime companion. I would appreciate much if I could send him to his new home if there is any kind-hearted soul out there willing to take him and make him part of your family.",85fd5df90,2,4

In the midst of dying of hunger, luckily an angel came. He is the shop owner there, and he decided we should live, found all of us a temporarily foster home to take care of us.

Kitten must be kept indoors to avoid accidents. 2. Kitten must follow up with the vaccinations. 3. Kitten must be spayed when reaches 6 months old. Rescuer Note: Kitten is not ready to be neutered yet until he/she is 6 months old. It is very important to neuter him/her when he/she is ready, as this will prevent him/her from getting lost. The male cat will wander off your home to find any female cat on heat, while the female cat will wander off when on heat, and will get pregnant. Risk of losing your cat is very high if you don't neuter them. And also your cat may risk injury due to fighting or your furniture will risk damage as well, as un-neutered cat is more aggressive.",cd2451ab4,7,3

She has been vaccinated, dewormed for the 1st round and given immune tabs to boost her immune as well. For the left eye, she was given a special kind of oilment to aid healing and also a maintenance to avoid any infection. She has been with me for about a month now. The eye doesn't bother her at all.

Currently she is having heavy hairfall. bought to the UPM vet and the vet said its not fungus o kurap. she is like that because of change of diet and lack of vitamins. Now she is under the multi-coat vitamins and Omega 3 cat food The SPCA lady told us the person brought her in said he found her with her male partner. i dont know if its true or not because she is heavy, healthy and very gorgeous cat.(rare to see stray cats look like this plus she comes in with her partner). the color and everything just like the burmese cat BUT miss Jensen's tail is 3/4 long meanwhile her partner have full length tail and shinning coat and he has been adopted (bless that family). Both are super gorgeous ;). We call her Ms Jensen or Ms Heels because of her nails that sticking out of her paws and everytime she runs, we can hear this 'tuk tuk tuk' sound. like a lady running in heels! so funny her. Anyways,Miss Jensen: 1)toilet trained. 2)so manja and always fight with vanilla just to get our attention. 3)She follows us everywer 4)so bz body, u open the cupboard she jumps in. u open the drawer she jumps in. 5)eat iams/royal canin 6)Gorgeous green eyes, apple shaped head. 7)Love baskets/boxes ---> she always rebut2 with vanilla. 8)Super playful, especially at nite. 9)likes to sleep nxt to u on the bed, between ur legs 10) rarely hear her meowing. 11) She likes looking at you with full big round eyes. 12) she is so clever, sometimes her behavior like a dog. 13) BUT miss Jensen does not like to be cuddle and pat her head too long. Right now Miss Jensen is not up for adoption but if the person willing to take care of her at her current stage, it wud be lovely because i have 4 kittens and 2 females cat that still under my care.

I've only had one loving owner but since she's moved, the management of her new condo does not allow the keeping of pets. So I am hoping to find a new kind owner who is willing to adopt me. My owner has already vaccinated and de-wormed me. I've always been kept indoors so I am very healthy without any disease or ticks. I also know basic tricks like sit, stay, come, down, roll, paw (shake hand) and fetch. I hope to find a new family that will love me and that I can love back. If possible a family that will keep me indoors and not caged. If this sounds like you and you are located in KL area, please do contact my owner. I promise that I will try to be a good and loyal doggie. Please adopt me. Love Always, Oreo P/S: My current owner also has a doggie cage, toys, chew snacks, and dog food which she is willing to give away FOC to my rescuer. She will also send me for full grooming before handing me over. =========================================== Additional info about Oreo - Oreo is 90% toilet trained. He goes outside at the laundry area where I put newspapers. But sometimes he leaves me little “presents” in the house. - I don’t cage Oreo at all so he’s not used to be locked up in a cage. - Oreo stays home most of the time but I will bring him out at least once every two weeks. He loves being in the car and is very well behaved. Never did ""business"" in the car before or get car sick. - If Oreo knows that there's someone in the house he generally doesn't bark at all, but he will bark a bit if he's left alone in house. - Oreo is more ""sticky"" compared to my previous dogs. He will follow you around the house no matter what you are doing. So he's not the type that will only come to you if you have food. - Currently I feed Oreo dried dog food (Blackwood) mixed with either canned dog food or some rice + leftovers. - Oreo's fur does get much longer (can probably touch the floor) than in the photos. I kept it short on purpose as it is easier to maintain. - Oreo sleeps alone outside in the living room area, he's not allowed in the bedroom.",8f15fc3d8,11,1
